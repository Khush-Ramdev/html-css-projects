            <h3>Keyword</h3>
            <p>
                Keywords are predefined, reserved words used in programming that have special meanings to the compiler.
                Keywords are part of the syntax and they cannot be used as an identifier. For example:
                <p id="code">
                    <code>
                    int money;
                 </code>
                </p>
                <h3>Identifier</h3>
                <p>
                    Identifier refers to name given to entities such as variables, functions, structures etc.Identifiers
                    must be unique. They are created to give a unique name to an entity to identify it during the
                    execution of the program. For example int money; double accountBalance;
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <lh>
                        Rules for naming identifiers
                    </lh>
                    <li>A valid identifier can have letters (both uppercase and lowercase letters), digits and
                        underscores.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The first letter of an identifier should be either a letter or an underscore.
                        You cannot use keywords as identifiers.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        There is no rule on how long an identifier can be. However, you may run into problems in some
                        compilers if the identifier is longer than 31 characters.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You can choose any name as an identifier if you follow the above rule, however, give meaningful
                        names to identifiers that make sense
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Variable</h3>
                <p>
                    In programming, a variable is a container (storage area) to hold data.To indicate the storage area,
                    each variable should be given a unique name (identifier). Variable names are just the symbolic
                    representation of a memory location. For example:
                </p>
                <p id="code">
                    <code>
                        int playerScore = 95;
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here, playerScore is a variable of int type. Here, the variable is assigned an integer value 95.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <lh>
                        Rules for naming a variable
                    </lh>
                    <li>
                        A variable name can only have letters (both uppercase and lowercase letters), digits and
                        underscore.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The first letter of a variable should be either a letter or an underscore.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        There is no rule on how long a variable name (identifier) can be. However, you may run into
                        problems in some compilers if the variable name is longer than 31 characters.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Literals</h3>
                <p>
                    Literals are data used for representing fixed values. They can be used directly in the code. For
                    example:
                    1, 2.5, 'c' etc.
                    Here, 1, 2.5 and 'c' are literals. Why? You cannot assign different values to these terms.
                </p>
                <h3>Constants</h3>
                <p>
                    If you want to define a variable whose value cannot be changed, you can use the const keyword. This
                    will create a constant. For example,
                </p>
                <p>
                    <code>
                        const double PI = 3.14;
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>

                    Notice, we have added keyword const.
                    Here, PI is a symbolic constant; its value cannot be changed.
                </p>

                <h3>Integers</h3>
                <p>
                    Integers are whole numbers that can have both zero, positive and negative values but no decimal
                    values. For example, 0, -5, 10
                    We can use int for declaring an integer variable.
                    <p id="code">
                        <code>
                        int id;
                    </code>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Here, id is a variable of type integer.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Float and Double</h3>
                    <p>
                        float and double are used to hold real numbers.
                        float salary;
                        double price;
                        In C, floating-point numbers can also be represented in exponential. For example,float
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <code>
                        normalizationFactor = 22.442e2;
                    </code>

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What's the difference between float and double?
                        The size of float (single precision float data type) is 4 bytes. And the size of double (double
                        precision float data type) is 8 bytes.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Char</h3>
                    <p>
                        Keyword char is used for declaring character type variables. For example,
                    </p>
                    <p id="code">
                        <code>
                        char test = 'h';
                    </code>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The size of the character variable is 1 byte.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Void</h3>
                    <p>
                        void is an incomplete type. It means "nothing" or "no type". You can think of void as absent.
                        For example, if a function is not returning anything, its return type should be void.Note that,
                        you
                        cannot create variables of void type.

                <p>
                    In C programming, printf() is one of the main output function. The function sends formatted output
                    to the screen. For example,
                </p>
                <p id="code">
                    <code>
                        #include <stdio.h><br/>
                            int main()<br/>
                            {<br/> // Displays the string inside quotations<br/>
                            printf("C Programming");<br/>
                            return 0;<br/>
                            }<br/>

                <p>

                    In C programming, scanf() is one of the commonly used function to take input from the user. The
                    scanf() function reads formatted input from the standard input such as keyboards.
                    Example 5: Integer Input/Output
                </p>
                <p id="code">

            <div>
                <p>
                    An operator is a symbol that operates on a value or a variable. For example: + is an operator to
                    perform addition.

                    C has a wide range of operators to perform various operations.
                </p>
                <h3>C Arithmetic Operators</h3>
                <p>
                    An arithmetic operator performs mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction,
                    multiplication, division etc on numerical values (constants and variables).
                </p>
                <h3>C Increment and Decrement Operators</h3>
                <p>
                    C programming has two operators increment ++ and decrement -- to change the value of an operand
                    (constant or variable) by 1.

                    Increment ++ increases the value by 1 whereas decrement -- decreases the value by 1. These two
                    operators are unary operators, meaning they only operate on a single operand.
                </p>
                <h3>C Assignment Operators</h3>
                <p>

                    An assignment operator is used for assigning a value to a variable. The most common assignment
                    operator is =
                </p>
                <h3>C Relational Operators</h3>
                <p>

                    A relational operator checks the relationship between two operands. If the relation is true, it
                    returns 1; if the relation is false, it returns value 0.

                    Relational operators are used in decision making and loops.
                </p>
                <h3> C Logical Operators</h3>
                <p>

                    An expression containing logical operator returns either 0 or 1 depending upon whether expression
                    results true or false. Logical operators are commonly used in decision making in C programming.
                </p>
                <h3>C Bitwise Operators</h3>
                <p>

                    During computation, mathematical operations like: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division,
                    etc are converted to bit-level which makes processing faster and saves power.

                    Bitwise operators are used in C programming to perform bit-level operations.

                    An array is a variable that can store multiple values. For example, if you want to store 100
                    integers, you can create an array for it.
